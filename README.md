**RStudio addin to evaluate function parameters via shortcut**

This addin's use case was inspired by my personal workflow but technical details and the idea to use a GIF to showcase the pacakge were shamelessly copy and pasted from [Jenny 'Queen of Den-Nerdification' Brians related *jadd* addin](https://github.com/jennybc/jadd).
